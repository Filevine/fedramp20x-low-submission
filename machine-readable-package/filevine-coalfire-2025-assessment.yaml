                        Content: The @DevOps Admin maintains a current baseline
                        configuration of Vinesign in @GitLab, as outlined in the
                        @Configuration Management Plan. This includes:

                        Hardening Vinesign for security while maintaining
                        functionality.

                        Enabling only essential ports, protocols, and services.

                        Ensuring associated accounts are secure and compliant.

                        Disabling non-essential functions, ports, protocols, and
                        services.

                        Adhering to the principle of least privilege for device
                        operations and access.


                        Authorized personnel approve, test, and deploy any
                        changes to these baselines through the @Change
                        Management Process, with updates documented in @GitLab.

                        Content: Vinesign uses @AWS, a FedRAMP 20x-compliant
                        cloud component that meets data protection requirements.


                        End User Responsibility: All customer data uploaded to
                        Vinesign by the customer in @AWS are encrypted using
                        @Amazon Server-Side Encryption, with AES-256 keys while
                        they are stored within the environment. All disks that
                        contain customer data are encrypted using OS level
                        encryption. All encryption within the environment is
                        done using a FIPS 140-2 validated module. The same
                        encryption mechanisms are applied to backup systems and
                        data stores that contain customer data.

                        safeguard requirements when signing the @Rules of
                        Behavior Agreement. Authorized users receive their
                        account information including a temporary password in
                        person or via telephone after their identity is
                        verified. Remote users receive their credentials via
                        telephone. Users must change their temporary password
                        immediately upon login.
                         If a user loses or compromises their password, they must create a helpdesk ticket in @ServiceDesk Plus and the @Identity Team resets and distributes the new password in person or via phone.

                        control.


                        End User Responsibility: The @DevOps Admin employs
                        @Amazon Security Groups for boundary protection in
                        Vinesign, limiting use to allowed ports, protocols, and
                        services. Traffic to Vinesign is directed through @ELB,
                        featuring two access points:

                        the Vinesign web interface, requiring valid credentials,

                        Filevine, Inc. admin access from authorized devices,

                        Vinesign through a controlled @Change Management

                        Title: Change Request

                        Content: Change proposals for Vinesign are assessed in
                        @GitLab by component owners, encompassing activities and
                        decisions. The @Change Control Board conducts bi-weekly
                        monitoring of the @Change Management Process. Only
                        administrators with @Zscaler Private Access
                        authorization can execute changes. 


                        The @DevOps Admin tracks and records all releases for
                        Vinesign indefinitely using @Octopus Deploy.

                        Content: Vinesign code undergoes peer review by a
                        @Developer, using @GitLab for static analysis to
                        identify common flaws. Changes are implemented,
                        reviewed, and approved before deployment into the
                        staging environment.

                        Title: Software Development Lifecycle Process

                        Content: Filevine, Inc. has a defined @Software
                        Development Life Cycle Process for software development
                        on Vinesign. The @Product Manager and @Developer review
                        product requirements and create user stories in @GitLab.

                        @Developer uses @GitLab for standard naming conventions,
                        creating branches, and running automated tests.

                        After coding is completed, the @Developer ensures that
                        the requirements are satisfied, attaches a code review
                        template, and marks it "under review." @Octopus Deploy
                        automatically runs a suite of tests to ensure Vinesign
                        is working correctly.

                        The @DevOps Admin lead completes the final review of
                        changes and pushes them from staging to production. The
                        @DevOps Admin monitors the environment to ensure
                        Vinesign works correctly.

                        Title: Change Request

                        Content: Change proposals for Vinesign are assessed in
                        @GitLab by component owners, encompassing activities and
                        decisions. The @Change Control Board conducts bi-weekly
                        monitoring of the @Change Management Process. Only
                        administrators with @Zscaler Private Access
                        authorization can execute changes. 


                        The @DevOps Admin tracks and records all releases for
                        Vinesign indefinitely using @Octopus Deploy.

                        Content: When a Filevine, Inc. team seeks budget for
                        services, they must outline functional requirements and
                        conduct a cost-benefit analysis to decide between
                        external vendors or internal development. 

                        If opting for a vendor, the @GRC Admin evaluates risks
                        for compliance with Vinesign's supply chain standards. 

                        Following the @GRC Admin's approval, the @Operations
                        Admin grants final authorization for procuring the
                        services.

                        Content: Filevine, Inc. conducts an annual @Incident
                        Response Test Process, a tabletop exercise selected by
                        the @Incident Response Admin in accordance with NIST SP
                        800-61. Test results are used to update incident
                        response documentation and processes, investigating any
                        weaknesses discovered during the exercise.

                        If a major incident invokes the @Incident Response Plan
                        during the quarterly period between reviews, that
                        incident serves as training in lieu of the annual
                        exercise.

                        Content: Vinesign uses @EC2 & @ECS and operates in
                        multiple availability zones. @Contingency Plan Test
                        Process is performed annually and aims to quickly
                        restore system functionality in case of an outage. The
                        test includes a walkthrough, tabletop exercise, advanced
                        tabletop/simulation, or functional exercise. Results are
                        reviewed by the @GRC Admin and @DevOps Admin to
                        determine necessary changes which are tracked for

                        Title: Incident Response Reporting Guidelines

                        Content: All personnel from Filevine, Inc. must report
                        any suspected or actual security incidents, including
                        insider threats, to the @Incident Response Admin via
                        email, as indicated in the @Incident Response Plan.
                        Incidents should be reported within 1 hour of discovery,
                        and the timeframes for different incident categories
                        (see table) should be followed, unless the data owner
                        specifies a more restrictive guidance.

                        Incident Category Description Impact Notification Time
